Evaluation for homework 01: Calendar Stuff and CountTheDays

CalendarStuff and CountTheDays program
Includes running CalendarStuffTester test program
Includes running automated CountTheDays program
=================================================

Comments:
---------
There are some problems here.  You didn't implement any code for the
"dateEquals()"" and "compareDate()" methods so I don't know how you
can tell if two dates are equal or out of order.  Secondly, in your
"daysBetween()" method I think you aren't counting the days correctly.
This will cause you to fail on your "CountTheDays" program.  Next,
we are dealing with whole number years, not 365.25 days per year --
I realize that's the correct duration, but we are handling leap years
to cover that.

Perhaps we can have an office hour session so that I can clarify a
few things.  Please feel free to schedule something in YouCanBookMe
or drop by my office.
