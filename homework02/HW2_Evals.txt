Die, DiceSet, and HighRoll Program
Includes running DieAndDiceSetTestHarness
Includes running automated HighRoll tests
=========================================

COMMENTS:

I had to take 1/2 point off for the "rollIndividual()" method, which
ONLY rolls the die at index 1, NOT a user-selected die.  It would also
have been helpful to have some output after each selection to see the
result of the operation on the dice set, but I didn't take off points
for that since it wasn't specified.

It was left as an exercise for you, not just as the programmer but
also looking from the USER perspective, to realize that knowing the
result would be useful.  

A total of one point each for the following:

class Die         : Exists, coding style acceptable   - 1 point
constructor       : works                             - 1 point
roll              : works                             - 1 point
getValue          : works                             - 1 point
setSides          : works                             - 1 point
instan. toString  : works                             - 1 point
class toString    : works                             - 1 point
main for testing  : Exists, with some tests in it     - 1 point

class DiceSet     : Exists, coding style acceptable   - 1 point
constructor       : works                             - 1 point

roll              : works                             - 1 point
rollIndividual    : works                             - 0.5 point
getIndividual     : works                             - 1 point
instan. toString  : works                             - 1 point
class toString    : works                             - 1 point
isIdentical       : works                             - 1 point
main for testing  : Exists, with some tests in it     - 1 point

class HighRoll    : Exists, coding style acceptable   - 1 point
TUI:              : works, all options present        - 1 point
option 1 roll all : works                             - 1 point
option 2 roll one : works                             - 1 point
option 3 sum      : works                             - 1 point
option 4 save     : works                             - 1 point
option 5 display  : works                             - 1 point
option 6 quit     : works                             - 1 point

Files in Git      : all three present                 - 1 point
Test Harness      : passes all evaluation tests       - 1 point
HighRoll          : passes all evaluation tests       - 2 point

Total 29.5 out of 30 = 98.33% which is still an A-plus

Nice work!
