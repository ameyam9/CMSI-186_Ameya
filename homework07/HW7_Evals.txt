Evaluation
==========
Your output format for the standalone tests is incorrect.  You were supposed
to have each of the denominations on a separate line as showed in the web
page and git examples.  I stressed this in class a couple of times, so this
costs you one of the Extra Credit points.

   35 out of 34 = 102.94% which is an A-plus

Near perfect job, Ameya...  Nice work and a great finish to the semester!
